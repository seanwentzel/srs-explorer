# String Rewriting System Explorer

Hosted [here](https://seanwentzel.github.io/srs-explorer/).

This is a lightweight in-browser tool to explore one rule String Rewriting Systems.

A good overview of the theory can be found [here](http://www.numdam.org/article/ITA_1999__33_3_279_0.pdf)

## Prioritized improvements

- Possibly detecting other duplicates. For example [this rule](https://seanwentzel.github.io/srs-explorer/?start_string=11000&in_string=100&out_string=00110) seems like it has trivial duplicates.
- Make it pretty in d3 or something.
